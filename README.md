# General Things to Do (In no particular order)
Scratchpad for future tasks. Flesh them out if and when necessary

## More geneneric/better designed tile system (for chunked lod)
- Seperate of tile data generation from tile selection
    - Presumably, tile data could come from anywhere and could have multple layers

## Data defintion language

## Lighting
- Add light support in renderer

## GBuffer
- Deferred rendering (mostly to exercise more use cases of renderer)

## Reload modified shaders
- Watch shader directory for file changes. Attempt to recompile shaders when they get saved?

## Game Object Model
- ECS?
- Something else?

## Material System
- Define a material in data and use with mesh
- Update material definition at runtime

## Animated models (http://www.ogldev.org/www/tutorial38/tutorial38.html)
- Make a skinned mesh renderer

## Finish porting renderers to new 'Renderer Format'

## Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00288758)

## Constant Buffer Support
